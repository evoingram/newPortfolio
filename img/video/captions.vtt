WEBVTT - Resume Video Captions by Erica Ingram

1
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.280
Hello there.

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.480
My name is Erica Ingram
and I am an experienced software engineer

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.840
seeking a remote or hybrid position
with new challenges,

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.920
more responsibilities,
and new things to learn.

5
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.360
Since my background
is pretty non-traditional,

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.160
I'm here to tell you a little bit about me
and how we can connect

7
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.000
if you like what you see.

8
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
I did not become a software engineer via
the traditional route.

9
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.320
For 13 years I owned and operated
a transcription business remotely.

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.120
I didn't have a lot of capital, so
I needed to do a lot of the labor myself.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.040
That included a website
and also eventually software to help me

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.760
focus more on the transcribing work
rather than on the many unpaid

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.520
administrative tasks
that are required in such a business.

14
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.200
So I learned to code.

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.280
I built my own website
and over several years

16
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.920
my own transcript management software.
Since I was already

17
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.360
incredibly familiar with Office
from being a transcriber,

18
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.440
I wrote this software
with Visual Basic in the Office IDE.

19
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.920
My company's transcripts were

20
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.840
truly unique and had features
that no other companies' did.

21
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.160
The software integrated with Word, Excel,

22
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.000
Publisher, Outlook Express, Scribe, FTR

23
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.640
Player, Acrobat, Wunderlist and PayPal,
among others.

24
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.160
I built a speech recognition
engine using batch files and PocketSphinx

25
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.640
and then integrated that engine
into an Access database.

26
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.840
I cleaned up and automated
feeding all the data,

27
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920
audio and transcripts, to the engine
so it can learn.

28
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.280
My clients often struggled
with researching

29
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.040
and later referencing
cases and rules mentioned in hearings.

30
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.960
This manual research process
takes considerable time and effort,

31
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.480
especially when you are not familiar
with how the legal system works.

32
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.520
I automated this research process
by creating a system

33
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.520
that identifies and formats
and hyperlinks citations and generates

34
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.200
a table of authorities using VB
and the CourtListener API.

35
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.320
It categorized each citation
into one of three types of references

36
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.800
and my innovative solution
improved efficiency for and saved

37
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.320
valuable time and effort for clients
up to dozens of hours for each client

38
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.640
per transcript.

39
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.040
Truly, I love doing all

40
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.200
that so much that when I found Lambda,
I knew what I needed to do.

41
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.760
I love building things
and solving problems, so of course

42
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.920
at that point I wanted to do it
full time and permanently.

43
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.040
In 2019, I attended Lambda School,
now called BloomTech,

44
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.360
which is a vocational academy
that offers a nine month

45
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.840
full stack web development program.

46
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.600
And I graduated in July 2020.

47
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.240
The program taught me a JavaScript

48
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.080
Node, PostgreSQL, React stack.

49
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.840
While in school, I operated my business
for 20 to 30 hours a week

50
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.840
and went to school for
over 40 hours a week.

51
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.040
I also served as tech lead for the school
for six of those nine months

52
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.120
where my team consisted of seven
plus students.

53
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.920
I am a lifelong learner,
so ever since I left school

54
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.560
I have read and studied one tech book
approximately every couple of weeks,

55
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.440
spending around 10 to 30 hours
per week on professional development.

56
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.000
And I now use AI to help me read, consume
and learn more material than ever.

57
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.640
My first

58
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.640
position post-Lambda was remote
as a software engineer

59
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.520
at Clearcover Insurance, an insurtech
based out of Chicago, Illinois.

60
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.720
I worked there for about 14 months
before I was promoted and left to join

61
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.320
SoFi a couple of months later.
I built features and fixed bugs there

62
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.720
on a Kotlin JavaScript,
TypeScript, PostgreSQL, React stack.

63
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.480
One challenge I took on it
Clearcover was when they needed a robust

64
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.200
welcome email system to engage
customers effectively

65
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.280
and provide essential information
when onboarding.

66
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.400
My task was to create the
infrastructure for the welcome

67
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.160
email system,
which would send emails to every customer

68
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.320
upon policy purchase.
I developed the entire system, pulling info

69
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.280
from Kafka events, incorporating
attachments and authentication links.

70
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.760
The process involved data

71
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.560
transfer through multiple services
and rigorous unit testing.

72
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.120
This welcome email system reaching every
single customer, played a pivotal role

73
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.999
in enhancing Clearcover's customer
onboarding process, and communicating.

74
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.160
SoFi is a fintech providing banking, credit
card, investment

75
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.320
loans and other related services
through their tech platform.

76
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.400
At SoFi, I worked on several teams

77
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.480
first supporting their
financial insight product,

78
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.080
and then their credit card product,
and lastly, their investor product.

79
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.920
I worked on a Kotlin Java PostgreSQL

80
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.240
React stack and also a couple of Ruby
and Angular services.

81
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.920
A product I worked on at SoFi

82
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.160
had initially prioritized

83
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.400
its launch over optimization,
resulting in numerous

84
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.680
duplicative and suboptimal
API calls within the system.

85
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.960
These issues adversely affected
the speed and efficiency

86
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.680
of customer interactions
with this product.

87
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.080
My task was to optimize that product

88
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.960
cycle, identify inefficiencies
and propose a solution

89
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.360
to enhance the customer experience
while reducing waste.

90
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.680
I began by thoroughly documenting
and diagramming various

91
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.480
aspects of the system
which lacked proper documentation.

92
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.640
I then conducted a detailed analysis
to pinpoint

93
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.720
duplicative and suboptimal API calls.

94
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.040
This analysis included
quantifying the financial and time costs

95
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.800
associated with these inefficiencies.

96
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.080
To make a compelling
case for optimization,

97
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.360
I calculated potential savings
for both customers and our organization.

98
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.000
With a solid plan in place

99
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.720
I executed that optimization strategy,
and through my efforts,

100
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.880
I successfully identified
and resolved the duplicative

101
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.360
and suboptimal API calls significantly
improving the product's performance.

102
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.120
Customers experienced enhanced
speed and efficiency when using related

103
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.280
services, leading to
increased satisfaction of course.

104
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.280
Additionally, our organization benefited
from cost savings and improved resource

105
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.960
allocation, making the optimization
efforts a worthwhile investment.

106
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.360
This optimization initiative
not only resolved

107
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.840
technical inefficiencies,
but also contributed

108
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.880
to a better customer experience
and a more efficient resource utilization.

109
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.240
I received some recommendations
on LinkedIn,

110
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.160
two of them from direct managers

111
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160
at SoFi, and another two from former

112
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.680
SoFi colleagues who worked
with me side by side every day.

113
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.520
They all speak to

114
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.520
my soft skills
and I've listed here some examples,

115
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.840
but I highly recommend
you visit my LinkedIn recommendations

116
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.998
to see what they had to say about me
in full.

117
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.360
I'm a high performing team player.

118
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.000
I learn quickly and I get results,
As you can tell from this video,

119
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.680
I will always bring my A-game
and I will take my resourcefulness,

120
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.680
discipline, empathy, respect, problem

121
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.680
solving, ability,
teamwork and grit with me wherever I land.

122
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.000
If you have something that you think
I'd be a great fit for, you can contact me

123
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.600
in the ways you see here, which are all provided
on my portfolio below this video.

124
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.200
Thanks for watching and you have a great day.
